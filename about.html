                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Mangata & Gallo is a jewelry store that specializes in jewelry for special occasions like
                    engagements, weddings, and anniversaries. Primarily an online store, Mangata & Gallo also has a
                    small storefront in Austin, Texas, with an atelier attached for browsing.</p>

                <p>Known for its high-quality craftsmanship and classic look, Mangata & Gallo offers a wide selection of
                    fine jewelry. Each piece is designed with attention to detail, ensuring it reflects the timeless
                    elegance the brand is known for.</p>

                <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
                <p><strong>Mariana</strong>, the owner and lead designer of Mangata & Gallo, has been creating exquisite
                    jewelry for years. After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond cutting and
                    metal smithing, she returned to her hometown of Austin to open her first store. Since then, she has
                    expanded her business online while maintaining her passion for hands-on jewelry crafting.</p>

                <p>Although Mariana managed every aspect of the business herself initially, she has recently hired
                    several artisans to help bring her designs to life and a young team member to handle the companyâ€™s
                    website and social media.</p>
